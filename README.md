# dayPlanner
This is a day planner that will allow updated of events/meetings that are planned through out the day. As this rools through if time is in futer it will be green as time is past it will be grey. Current time will be red. you can add text to the textarea and save the decription of events at that time. 

I used the moment.Js to determine the workday length of time. 

I did get some help for the section to display the multiple times so I didn't have to repeat this another 8 times.
